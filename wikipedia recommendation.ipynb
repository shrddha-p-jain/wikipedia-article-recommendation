The original cost of the building was $300000. Renovation costs totaled approximately $1.9 million.The theater opened on October 11 1926. Gillioz managed to secure a 100-year lease on one 16-foot (4.9 m) wide piece of property which bordered on U.S. Route 66 so that the theater could garner patrons who traveled on that historic highway. After many prosperous years and many not-so-prosperous years the \"Gillioz Theatre Beautiful\" finally offered its last show in the summer of 1980 an opera.The theater was originally a transition theater with a Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ for silent movies and a stage for live performances such as vaudeville acts.

       " 'Libertarianism (from French libertaire \"libertarian\"; from Latin libertas \"freedom\") is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as a core principle. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and political freedom emphasizing free association freedom of choice individualism and voluntary association. Libertarians share a skepticism of authority and state power but some libertarians diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing economic and political systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power often calling for the restriction or dissolution of coercive social institutions. Different categorizations have been used to distinguish various forms of libertarianism. Scholars distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital usually along left–right or socialist–capitalist lines.Libertarianism originated as a form of left-wing politics such as anti-authoritarian and anti-state socialists like anarchists especially social anarchists but more generally libertarian communistsMarxists and libertarian socialists. These libertarians seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production or else to restrict their purview or effects to usufruct property norms in favor of common or cooperative ownership and management viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. Left-libertarian ideologies include anarchist schools of thought alongside many other anti-paternalist and New Left schools of thought centered around economic egalitarianism as well as geolibertarianism green politics market-oriented left-libertarianism and the Steiner–Vallentyne school.In the mid-20th century right-libertarian proponents of anarcho-capitalism and minarchism co-opted the term libertarian to advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights such as in land infrastructure and natural resources. The latter is the dominant form of libertarianism in the United States where it advocates civil liberties natural law free-market capitalism and a major reversal of the modern welfare state.

       " \"Surveillance capitalism is an economic system centered around the commodification of personal data with the core purpose of profit-making. The concept of surveillance capitalism as described by Shoshana Zuboff arose as advertising companies led by Google's AdWords saw the possibilities of using personal data to target consumers more precisely. While industrial capitalism exploited and controlled nature with devastating consequences surveillance capitalism exploits and controls human nature with a totalitarian order as the endpoint of the development.Increased data collection may have various advantages for individuals and society such as self-optimization (Quantified Self) societal optimizations (such as by smart cities) and optimized services (including various web applications). However collecting and processing data in the context of capitalism's core profit-making motive might present a danger to human liberty autonomy and wellbeing. Capitalism has become focused on expanding the proportion of social life that is open to data collection and data processing. This may come with significant implications for vulnerability and control of society as well as for privacy.Economic pressures of capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and monitoring online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors directed at the making of profit andor the regulation of action. Therefore personal data points increased in value after the possibilities of targeted advertising were known.

       " 'The counterculture of the 1960s was an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed throughout much of the Western world between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the U.S. Civil Rights Movement continued to grow and with the expansion of the American Government\\'s extensive military intervention in Vietnam would later become revolutionary to some. As the 1960s progressed widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality women\\'s rights traditional modes of authority experimentation with psychoactive drugs and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.As the era unfolded what emerged were new cultural forms and a dynamic subculture that celebrated experimentation modern incarnations of Bohemianism and the rise of the hippie and other alternative lifestyles. This embrace of creativity is particularly notable in the works of musical acts such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan as well as of New Hollywood filmmakers whose works became far less restricted by censorship. Within and across many disciplines many other creative artists authors and thinkers helped define the counterculture movement. Everyday fashion experienced a decline of the suit and especially of the wearing of hats; styles based around jeans for both men and women became an important fashion movement that has continued up to the present day.Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the anti-authoritarian movements of previous eras. The post-World War II baby boom generated an unprecedented number of potentially disaffected youth as prospective participants in a rethinking of the direction of the United States and other democratic societies. Post-war affluence allowed much of the counterculture generation to move beyond the provision of the material necessities of life that had preoccupied their Depression-era parents. The era was also notable in that a significant portion of the array of behaviors and \"causes\" within the larger movement were quickly assimilated within mainstream society particularly in the US even though counterculture participants numbered in the clear minority within their respective national populations.In general the counterculture era commenced in earnest with the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963; became absorbed into the popular culture with the termination of U.S. combat military involvement in Southeast Asia; and ultimately concluded with the end of the draft in 1973 and the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.  1960s 1970s All articles needing additional references All articles with unsourced statements Anti-war protests Articles needing additional references from February 2020 Articles with French-language sources (fr) Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from September 2020 British Invasion CS1 Czech-language sources (cs) CS1 maint archived copy as title CS1 maint extra text authors list CS1 maint multiple names authors list Counterculture Counterculture of the 1960s Short description is different from Wikidata Use mdy dates from April 2021 Webarchive template wayback links',\n",

       " 'Nettime is an internet mailing list proposed in 1995 by Geert Lovink and Pit Schultz (then half-jokingly called \"the nettime brothers\") at the second meeting of the \"Medien Zentral Kommittee\" during the Venice Biennale. Since 1998 Ted Byfield and Felix Stalder have moderated the main list coordinated moderation of other lists in the nettime \"family\" and maintained the site as their nexus.The name nettime was chosen as a statement against space metaphors such as cyberspace dominant at the time.The time of nettime is a social time it is subjective and intensive with condensation and extractions segmented by social events like conferences and little meetings and text gatherings for export into the paper world. Most people still like to read a text printed on wooden paper more than transmitted via waves of light. Nettime is not the same time like geotime or the time clocks go. Everyone who programs or often sits in front of a screen knows about the phenomena of being out of time time on the net consists of different speeds computers humans software bandwidth the only way to see a continuity of time on the net is to see it as a asynchronous network of synchronized time zones.Nettime has been widely recognized for its seminal role stimulating and disseminating ideas about Netzkritik or Net Critique net.art and tactical media and pioneered practices such as \"collaborative filtering\". For example in 2004 nettime was nominated for an Ars Electronica Golden Nica award. However the moderators refuse to speak or act as representatives of an organization preferring instead to serve inasmuch as possible as coordinators of a loose or \"headless\" collective.The list and related meetings were a strong influence on Bruce Sterling\\'s 1996 science fiction novel Holy Fire.Initially it was both part of an early wave of and served as an inspiration for a number of related efforts such as Blast (1995–1998) Rhizome (1996–present) Fibreculture (2001–present) Faces-l and -empyre- (2002–present). Unlike these other efforts which typically sought to affiliate themselves with institutions in order to become institutionalized nettime has remained independent — at times fiercely so. Thus unusually for a mailing list the family of lists has successfully migrated across a series of hosts — many of them culturally significant in their own right — including in-berlin.de desk.nl material.net thing.net De Waag kein.org and bitnik.org.From the beginning the aim has been to provide a space for a new form of critical discourse on and with the nets focussing on longer substantive yet non-academic writings and discussions. Nettime served early on as a pre-publishing and discussion platform to give critical thinkers and writers an international reach. Due to its particular political style it was often seen as a European online salon even though it had from the beginning strong non-European mainly North-American participation.The list once called \"the world\\'s most world list\" by Bruce Sterling has been characterized by pragmatic approach with relatively little change to its format over the years which has proven to be resilient and durable. The expansive projects of building a web-based platforms reacting to and generating growing controversies were unsustainable. The original mainly English-language mailing list (nettime-l) has spawned several other more local lists better suited to specific regional and or linguistic contexts including nettiime-ann (announcements) nettime-fr (French) nettime-lat (Spanish and Portuguese) nettime-nl (Dutch) nettime-ro (Romanian) nettime-see (southeastern Europe) and nettime-zh (Chinese).

Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.An ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example an e-book a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book will each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.The initial ISBN identification format was devised in 1967 based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the 9-digit SBN code can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit '0').Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.Another identifier the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers.

       " \"Holland is a geographical region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name Holland is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries and is also commonly employed by the Dutch themselves. However some in the Netherlands particularly those from regions outside Holland find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country.From the 10th to the 16th century Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the counts of Holland. By the 17th century the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic.The area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland into which it was divided and which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities the capital city of Amsterdam; Rotterdam home of Europe's largest port; and the seat of government of The Hague. Holland has a population of 6583534 as of November 2019 and a density of 1203km2 (3120sq mi).

The rhetorician Quintilian regarded his Odes as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading \"He can be lofty sometimes yet he is also full of charm and grace versatile in his figures and felicitously daring in his choice of words.\"Horace also crafted elegant hexameter verses (Satires and Epistles) and caustic iambic poetry (Epodes). The hexameters are amusing yet serious works friendly in tone leading the ancient satirist Persius to comment \"as his friend laughs Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in he plays about the heartstrings\".His career coincided with Rome\\'s momentous change from a republic to an empire. An officer in the republican army defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC he was befriended by Octavian\\'s right-hand man in civil affairs Maecenas and became a spokesman for the new regime. For some commentators his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was \"a master of the graceful sidestep\") but for others he was in John Dryden\\'s phrase \"a well-mannered court slave\".  1st-century BC Romans 1st-century BC writers 65 BC births 8 BC deaths AC with 33 elements All articles with unsourced statements Ancient Roman soldiers Ancient literary critics Articles with BIBSYS identifiers Articles with BNC identifiers Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with CANTIC identifiers Articles with CINII identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ICCU identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with Internet Archive links Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with LNB identifiers Articles with LibriVox links Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers Articles with NDL identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLA identifiers Articles with NLG identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with NLK identifiers Articles with NSK identifiers Articles with NTA identifiers Articles with PLWABN identifiers Articles with Project Gutenberg links Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with RISM identifiers Articles with RSL identifiers Articles with SELIBR identifiers Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with Trove identifiers Articles with ULAN identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with VcBA identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from August 2014 Golden Age Latin writers Horace Horatii Iambic poets Latin-language writers Pages using Sister project links with default search Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata Pages using Sister project links with wikidata mismatch Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch People from Venosa Roman-era Epicurean philosophers Roman-era poets Roman-era satirists Roman philhellenes Short description matches Wikidata Simple living advocates Use dmy dates from January 2021 Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference',\n",
       " 'An inquisitorial system is a legal system in which the court or a part of the court is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case. This is distinct from an adversarial system in which the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecution and the defense. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with civil legal systems such as France and Italy or legal systems based on Islamic law like Saudi Arabia rather than in common law systems. Countries using common law including the United States may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of misdemeanors or infractions such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common-law system. Some legal scholars consider inquisitorial misleading and prefer the word nonadversarial. The function is often vested in the office of the public procurator as in China Japan and Germany.

       " 'The Jus de non evocando is an ancient feudal right stating that no one can be kept from the competent court. It derives from a medieval principle that subjects of the Crown were entitled to ius de non evocando the right to enjoy the jurisdiction and protection of the Crown to which they were loyal. As such it is still present in several constitutions such as the German constitution the Italian constitution and the Dutch constitution.It has today become an important concept in public international law by which states refuse to extradite their own citizens. Some countries may refuse to extradite non-nationals who because of their crimes may be subject to the death penalty. This may be seen in the case of Canada and Mexico vis-à-vis the United States.This principle is frequently argued in cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The foundation lies in that the international tribunal by seizing jurisdiction over an international criminal trial from national courts is violating the principle of jus de non evocando. The Trial Chamber in the case of Dusko Tadic (IT-94-1 of the ICTY) stated that states give up some measure of sovereignty to be a part of the UN and the ICTY is a product of the UN therefore there is no violation.

       " 'In the 16th 17th and 18th centuries the regenten (the Dutch plural for regent) were the rulers of the Dutch Republic the leaders of the Dutch cities or the heads of organisations (e.g. \"regent of an orphanage\"). Though not formally a hereditary \"class\" they were de facto \"patricians\" comparable to that ancient Roman class. Since the late Middle Ages Dutch cities had been run by the richer merchant families who gradually formed a closed group. At first the lower-class citizens in the guilds and schutterijen could unite to form a certain counterbalance to the regenten but in the course of the 15th century the administration of the cities and towns became oligarchical in character. From the latter part of the 17th century the regent families were able to reserve government offices to themselves via quasi-formal contractual arrangements.

This war was fought between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina the Empire of Brazil and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history. Paraguay sustained large casualties but even the approximate numbers are disputed. Paraguay was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil. The war began in late 1864 as a result of a conflict between Paraguay and Brazil caused by the Uruguayan War. Argentina and Uruguay entered the war against Paraguay in 1865 and it then became known as the \"War of the Triple Alliance\".After Paraguay was defeated in conventional warfare it conducted a drawn-out guerrilla resistance – a strategy that resulted in the further destruction of the Paraguayan military and the civilian population. Much of the civilian population lost their lives due to battle hunger and disease. The guerrilla war lasted for 14 months until President Francisco Solano López was killed in action by Brazilian forces in the Battle of Cerro Corá on 1 March 1870.

Historically the division has been the default combined arms unit capable of independent operations. Smaller combined arms units such as the American regimental combat team (RCT) during World War II were used when conditions favored them. In recent times modern Western militaries have begun adopting the smaller brigade combat team (similar to the RCT) as the default combined arms unit with the division they belong to being less important.While the focus of this article is on army divisions in naval usage \"division\" has a completely different meaning referring to either an administrativefunctional sub-unit of a department (e.g. fire control division of the weapons department) aboard naval and coast guard ships shore commands and in naval aviation units (including navy marine corps and coast guard aviation) to a sub-unit of several ships within a flotilla or squadron or to two or three sections of aircraft operating under a designated division leader.

       " \"A military also known collectively as armed forces is a heavily armed highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. It is typically officially authorized and maintained by a sovereign state with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform. It may consist of one or more military branches such as an army navy air force space force marines or coast guard. The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.In broad usage the terms armed forces and military are often treated as synonymous although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. There are various forms of irregular military forces not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces they are less often referred to as simply military.A nation's military may function as a discrete social subculture with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing schools utilities logistics hospitals legal services food production finance and banking services. Beyond warfare the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state including internal security threats population control the promotion of a political agenda emergency services and reconstruction protecting corporate economic interests social ceremonies and national honour guards.The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself. Some of the most enduring images of classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders. The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramses II's reign and his monuments commemorate it in bas-relief. A thousand years later the first emperor of unified China Qin Shi Huang was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he had himself buried with an army of terracotta soldiers.The Romans paid considerable attention to military matters leaving to posterity many treatises and writings on the subject as well as many lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns.

       " \"Spanish (español or castellano lit.\\u2009'Castilian') is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today it is a global language with nearly 500 million native speakers mainly in the Americas and Spain. It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese and the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English Mandarin Chinese and Hindi.Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages of the Indo-European language family which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile in the 13th century. Modern Spanish was then taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire beginning in 1492 most notably to the Americas as well as territories in Africa and the Philippines.As a Romance language Spanish is a descendant of Latin and has one of the smaller degrees of difference from it (about 20%) alongside Sardinian and Italian. Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek. Alongside English and French it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world. Spanish does not feature prominently as a scientific language; however it is better represented in areas like humanities and social sciences. Spanish is also the third most used language on internet websites after English and Chinese.Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations and it is also used as an official language by the European Union the Organization of American States the Union of South American Nations the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States the African Union and many other international organizations.

       " \"The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864 – 20 February 1865) was fought between Uruguay's governing Blanco Party and an alliance consisting of the Empire of Brazil and the Uruguayan Colorado Party covertly supported by Argentina. Since its independence Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863 an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina whose president Bartolomé Mitre provided him with supplies Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.The fusionism movement collapsed as the Colorados abandoned the coalition to join Flores' ranks. The Uruguayan Civil War quickly escalated developing into a crisis of international scope that destabilized the entire region. Even before the Colorado rebellion the Blancos within fusionism had sought an alliance with Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López. Berro's now purely Blanco government also received support from Argentine federalists who opposed Mitre and his Unitarians. The situation deteriorated as the Empire of Brazil was drawn into the conflict. Almost one fifth of the Uruguayan population were considered Brazilian. Some joined Flores' rebellion spurred by discontent with Blanco government policies that they regarded as harmful to their interests. Brazil eventually decided to intervene in the Uruguayan affair to reestablish the security of its southern frontiers and its regional ascendancy.In April 1864 Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary José Antônio Saraiva to negotiate with Atanasio Aguirre who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864 after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war and for most of its duration the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war.In a combined offensive against Blanco strongholds the Brazilian–Colorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in Montevideo the national capital. Faced with certain defeat the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived war would have been regarded as an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests had Paraguayan intervention in support of the Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly Paraguayan War.

       " 'Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of value. With this definition entrepreneurship is viewed as change generally entailing risk beyond what is normally encountered in starting a business which may include other values than simply economic ones.More narrow definitions have described entrepreneurship as the process of designing launching and running a new business which is often similar to a small business or as the \"capacity and willingness to develop organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit.\" The people who create these businesses are often referred to as entrepreneurs. While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to \"lack of funding bad business decisions government policies an economic crisis lack of market demand or a combination of all of these.\"In the field of economics the term entrepreneur is used for an entity which has the ability to translate inventions or technologies into products and services.

       " 'Saudi Arabia officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a country in Western Asia. It spans the vast majority of the Arabian Peninsula with a land area of approximately 2150000 km2 (830000 sq mi). Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East and the second-largest country in the Arab world. It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north Kuwait to the northeast Qatar Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the east Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south; it is separated from Egypt and Israel in the north-west by the Gulf of Aqaba. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and most of its terrain consists of arid desert lowland steppe and mountains. Its capital and largest city is Riyadh with Mecca and Medina serving as important cultural and religious centers.The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations. The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world. The world\\'s second-largest religion Islam emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632 his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661) Umayyad (661–750) Abbasid (750–1517) and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia Africa and Europe.The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions Hejaz Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia (\\'Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh the ancestral home of his family the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamist lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a \"predominant feature of Saudi culture\"; although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in recent years. In its Basic Law Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion Arabic as its official language and Riyadh as its capital. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"the Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina) the two holiest places in Islam.Petroleum was discovered on 3 March 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world\\'s second largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world\\'s largest oil exporter controlling the world\\'s second largest oil reserves and the sixth largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economies.However the state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons including its role in the Yemeni Civil War alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record which has been characterized by the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment failure to adopt adequate measures against human trafficking state-sponsored discrimination against religious minorities and atheists and antisemitism and its strict interpretation of Shari\\'a law.The kingdom spends 8% of its GDP on the military (highest in the world after Oman) which places it as the world\\'s third biggest military spender behind the United States and China and the world\\'s largest arms importer from 2015 to 2019 receiving half of all the US arms exports to the Middle East. According to the BICC Saudi Arabia is the 28th most militarized country in the world and enjoys the region\\'s best military equipment qualitatively after Israel. However in recent years there have been continual calls for halting of arms sales to Saudi Arabia mainly due to alleged war crimes in Yemen and especially following the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East and eighteenth-largest in the world. Saudi Arabia also has one of the world\\'s youngest populations with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2 million being under 25 years old. In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the United Nations Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Arab League and OPEC.  1932 establishments in Saudi Arabia All Wikipedia articles in need of updating All articles containing potentially dated statements All articles with dead external links All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases All articles with unsourced statements Arabian Peninsula Arabic-speaking countries and territories Articles containing Arabic-language text Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2004 Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2012 Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2013 Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2014 Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2019 Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with Curlie links Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with HDS identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with MA identifiers Articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers Articles with NARA identifiers Articles with NDL identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with SELIBR identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with TDVİA identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with dead external links from July 2020 Articles with hAudio microformats Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with multiple maintenance issues Articles with permanently dead external links Articles with short description Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from June 2021 Articles with unsourced statements from February 2018 Articles with unsourced statements from February 2020 Articles with unsourced statements from July 2019 Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019 Articles with unsourced statements from October 2013 Articles with unsourced statements from September 2020 CS1 long volume value CS1 errors external links CS1 maint extra text authors list CS1 maint unfit URL Coordinates on Wikidata Countries in Asia G20 nations Islamic monarchies Kingdoms Member states of OPEC Member states of the Arab League Member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Member states of the United Nations Middle Eastern countries Near Eastern countries Pages including recorded pronunciations Pages using Sister project links with default search Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters Pages with broken reference names Pages with login required references or sources Pages with missing ISBNs Pages with reference errors Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia articles needing attention Short description is different from Wikidata States and territories established in 1932 Use dmy dates from October 2020 Webarchive template wayback links Western Asian countries Wikipedia articles in need of updating from April 2021 Wikipedia articles in need of updating from June 2021 Wikipedia pages semi-protected due to dispute',\n",
       " \"Bahrain ( (listen) bar-AYN; Arabic البحرين\\u200e romanized al-Baḥrayn locally [æl baħˈreːn] (listen)) officially the Kingdom of Bahrain (Arabic مملكة البحرين\\u200e Mamlakat al-Baḥrayn) is a country in the Persian Gulf. The island nation comprises a small archipelago made up of 50 natural islands and an additional 33 artificial islands centered on Bahrain Island which makes up around 83 percent of the country's landmass. The country is situated between the Qatari peninsula and the north eastern coast of Saudi Arabia to which it is connected by the 25-kilometre (16 mi) King Fahd Causeway. According to the 2020 census Bahrain's population numbers 1501635 people of which 712362 are Bahraini nationals. At 760 square kilometres (290 sq mi) in size it is the third-smallest nation in Asia after the Maldives and Singapore. The capital and largest city is Manama.Bahrain is the site of the ancient Dilmun civilization. It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries which were considered the best in the world into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to be influenced by Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad in 628 CE. Following a period of Arab rule Bahrain was ruled by the Portuguese Empire from 1521 until 1602 when they were expelled by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty. In 1783 the Bani Utbah clan captured Bahrain from Nasr Al-Madhkur and it has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal family with Ahmed al Fateh as Bahrain's first hakim.In the late 1800s following successive treaties with the British Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. In 1971 it declared independence. Formerly an emirate Bahrain was declared an Islamic constitutional monarchy in 2002. In 2011 the country experienced protests inspired by the regional Arab Spring. Bahrain's ruling Al Khalifa royal family has been criticised for violating the human rights of groups including dissidents political opposition figures and its majority Shia Muslim population.Bahrain developed the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf the result of decades of investing in the banking and tourism sectors; many of the world's largest financial institutions have a presence in the country's capital. It consequently has a high Human Development Index and is recognised by the World Bank as a high-income economy. Bahrain is a member of the United Nations Non-Aligned Movement Arab League Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

       " 'ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (Arabic عمر بن الخطاب\\u200e; c.\\u2009583584 – 3 November 644) also known as Umar or Omar was the second Rashidun caliph. He was one of the most powerful and influential Muslim caliphs in history. He was a senior companion and father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He succeeded Abu Bakr (632–634) as the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 23 August 634. He was an expert Muslim jurist known for his pious and just nature which earned him the epithet al-Farooq (\"the one who distinguishes (between right and wrong)\").Under Umar the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate ruling the Sasanian Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. His attacks against the Sasanian Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in less than two years (642–644). According to Jewish tradition Umar set aside the Christian ban on Jews and allowed them into Jerusalem and to worship. Umar was assassinated by the Persian slave Abu Lu\\'lu\\'a Firuz in 644.Umar is revered in the Sunni tradition as a great ruler and paragon of Islamic virtues and some hadiths identify him as the second greatest of the Sahabah after Abu Bakr. He is viewed negatively in the Twelver Shia tradition.  584 births 644 deaths 7th-century caliphs 7th-century murdered monarchs All Wikipedia articles needing clarification All articles lacking reliable references All articles with dead external links All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing Arabic-language text Articles lacking reliable references from September 2017 Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with CINII identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLA identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with NTA identifiers Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with Trove identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with dead external links from October 2021 Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2015 Articles with unsourced statements from December 2014 Articles with unsourced statements from December 2017 Articles with unsourced statements from January 2015 Articles with unsourced statements from July 2012 Articles with unsourced statements from July 2017 Articles with unsourced statements from June 2017 Articles with unsourced statements from October 2021 Assassinated caliphs CS1 Hebrew-language sources (he) CS1 errors bare URL CS1 errors missing title CS1 maint archived copy as title Commons category link from Wikidata Deaths by blade weapons Harv and Sfn no-target errors Male murder victims People of the Muslim conquest of Persia People who memorized the Quran Rashidun caliphs Sahabah who participated in the battle of Uhud Shahnameh characters Short description is different from Wikidata Umar Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference Wikipedia articles needing clarification from December 2014 Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from August 2021 Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages',\n",

       " 'A village is a clustered human settlement or community larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town (although the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns) with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though villages are often located in rural areas the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. Villages are normally permanent with fixed dwellings; however transient villages can occur. Further the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another not scattered broadly over the landscape as a dispersed settlement. In the past villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture and also for some non-agricultural societies. In Great Britain a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church. In many cultures towns and cities were few with only a small proportion of the population living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts and development of many trades. The trend of urbanization continues though not always in connection with industrialization. Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defence and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.In toponomastic terminology names of individual villages are called comonyms (from Ancient Greek κώμη village and ὄνομα name).

He was the last Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company which was dissolved bankrupt in 1799 but he remained in post as the Dutch state took over ruling its territories in the Indies. In that sense he was also the first state appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.Van Overstraten was appointed member-extraordinary of the Council of Justice (Raad van Justitie) in BataviaJakarta in 1780. He arrived in there in 1781. Subsequently he was promoted to full member. In the same year he was made interim Advocate-Fiscal. He was made Second Secretary to the High Government of the Indies in 1784. He was promoted in 1786 to First Secretary. He became Counsellor-extraordinary to the Dutch Council of the Indies in 1789. By 1791 he was Governor and Director of Java's Northeast Coast in which post he greatly distinguished himself. During his time in the Northeast Coast he was instrumental in getting Hamengkubuwono I established as the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. He wrote an historically important memoir for his successor containing information about that area during his term of office.On 16 August 1796 Pieter van Overstraten was selected as Governor-General. On 17 February 1797 Willem Arnold Alting resigned as Governor-General and Commissioner of Police (Commissaris-General). He handed over his offices to Van Overstaten.

In the Indonesian language the term bela-diri (lit. self-defense) is used to mean martial art and in essence the Indonesian fighting arts are meant as one\\'s defence against perceived threat and assault. Other than physical training they often include spiritual aspects to cultivate inner strength inner peace and higher psychological ends.Today Indonesian fighting styles are synonymous with pencak silat a term coined for the martial arts of the Indonesian archipelago. Nevertheless a number of fighting arts in Indonesia are not included within the category of silat. Western misconception links silat with \"jungle tribes\" but in actuality pencak silat was neither created nor traditionally practised by Indonesia\\'s tribal inhabitants many of whom have unique martial arts of their own. Some of these traditions have been preserved as a complete fighting system e.g. pencak silat and kuntao.

       " 'Ikat (in Indonesian languages means \"bind\") is a dyeing technique originated from Indonesia used to pattern textiles that employs resist dyeing on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric.In ikat the resist is formed by binding individual yarns or bundles of yarns with a tight wrapping applied in the desired pattern. The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as tie-dye and batik the resist is applied to the woven cloth whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth in ikat both fabric faces are patterned.A characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent \"blurriness\" to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth. The blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson. Ikats with little blurriness multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive. However the blurriness that is so characteristic of ikat is often prized by textile collectors.Ikat is produced in many traditional textile centres around the world including India to Central Asia Southeast Asia Japan (where it is called kasuri) Africa and Latin America. Double ikats—in which both the warp and weft yarns are tied and dyed before being woven into a single textile—are relatively rare because of the intensive skilled labour required to produce them.

       " 'The history of arrival and spread of Islam in Indonesia is unclear. One theory states it arrived directly from Arabia before the 9th century while another credits Sufi merchants and preachers for bringing Islam to Indonesian islands in the 12th or 13th century either from Gujarat in India or directly from the Middle East. Before the arrival of Islam the predominant religions in Indonesia were Hinduism (particularly its Shaivism tradition) and Buddhism.Initially the spread of Islam was slow and gradual. Though historical documents are incomplete the limited evidence suggests that the spread of Islam accelerated in the 15th century as the military power of Melaka Sultanate in Malay Peninsular today Malaysia and other Islamic Sultanates dominated the region aided by episodes of Muslim coup such as in 1446 wars and superior control of maritime trading and ultimate markets. During 1511 Tomé Pires found animists and Muslims in the north coast of Java. Some rulers were Islamized Muslims others followed the old Hindu and Buddhist traditions. By the reign of Sultan Agung of Mataram most of the older Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Indonesia had at least nominally converted to Islam. The last one to do so was Makassar in 1605. After the fall of Majapahit empire Bali became the refuge for the Hindu upper class Brahmins and their followers that fled from Java thus transferring the Hindu culture of Java to Bali. Hinduism and Buddhism remained extant in some areas of East Java where it syncretized with animism. Their traditions also continued in East and Central Java where they earlier held a sway. Animism was also practiced in remote areas of other islands of Indonesia.The spread of Islam in eastern islands of Indonesia is recorded in 1605 when three Islamic pious men collectively known as Dato\\' Tallu came to Makasar namely Dato\\'ri Bandang (Abdul Makmur or Khatib Tunggal) Dato\\'ri Pattimang (Sulaiman Ali or Khatib Sulung) and Dato\\'ri Tiro (Abdul Jawad or Khatib Bungsu). According to Christian Pelras (1985) Dato\\' Tallu converted King of Gowa and Tallo to Islam and changed their name to Sultan Muhammad.The spread of Islam was initially driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago. Traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were usually the first to convert to Islam. Dominant kingdoms included Mataram in Central Java and the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in the Maluku Islands to the east. By the end of the 13th century Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the 14th in northeast Malaya Brunei the southern Philippines and among some courtiers of East Java; and the 15th in Malacca and other areas of the Malay Peninsula. Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather it suggests the process was complicated and slow.Despite being one of the most significant developments in Indonesian history historical evidence is fragmentary and generally uninformative such that understandings of the coming of Islam to Indonesia are limited; there is considerable debate amongst scholars about what conclusions can be drawn about the conversion of Indonesian peoples.\\u200a3\\u200a The primary evidence at least of the earlier stages of the process are gravestones and a few travellers\\' accounts but these can only show that indigenous Muslims were in a certain place at a certain time. This evidence cannot explain more complicated matters such as how lifestyles were affected by the new religion or how deeply it affected societies. It cannot be assumed for example that because a ruler was known to be a Muslim that the process of Islamisation of that area was complete; rather the process was and remains to this day continuous in Indonesia. Nevertheless a clear turning point occurred when the Hindu empire Majapahit in Java fell to the Islamised Demak Sultanate. In 1527 the Muslim ruler renamed newly conquered Sunda Kelapa as Jayakarta (meaning \"precious victory\") which was eventually contracted to Jakarta. Assimilation increased rapidly in the wake of this conquest.  13th-century Islam 13th century in Indonesia All NPOV disputes All articles needing additional references All articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases All articles with unsourced statements Articles needing additional references from March 2017 Articles needing additional references from November 2019 Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from November 2019 Articles with unsourced statements from April 2019 Articles with unsourced statements from November 2019 CS1 Indonesian-language sources (id) CS1 Javanese-language sources (jv) EngvarB from September 2015 History of Islam in Indonesia NPOV disputes from February 2021 Precolonial states of Indonesia Spread of Islam Use dmy dates from September 2015',\n",

       " 'Tamil (; தமிழ் Tamiḻ [t̪amiɻ] pronunciation ) is a Dravidian language natively spoken by the Tamil people of South Asia. Tamil is an official language of the sovereign nations of Sri Lanka and Singapore the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry. Tamil is spoken by significant minorities in the four other South Indian states of Kerala Karnataka Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also spoken by the Tamil diaspora found in many countries including Malaysia Myanmar South Africa United Kingdom United States Canada Australia and Mauritius. Tamil is also natively spoken by Sri Lankan Moors.One of 22 scheduled languages in the Constitution of India Tamil was the first to be classified as a classical language of India and is one of the longest-surviving classical languages in the world. A. K. Ramanujan described it as \"the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past.\" The variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to it being described as \"one of the great classical traditions and literatures of the world\".A recorded Tamil literature has been documented for over 2000 years. The earliest period of Tamil literature Sangam literature is dated from ca. 300 BC – AD 300. It has the oldest extant literature among Dravidian languages. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and \\'hero stones\\' date from around the 3rd century BC. More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55000) found by the Archaeological Survey of India are in the Tamil language. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. The two earliest manuscripts from India acknowledged and registered by the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005 were written in Tamil.In 1578 Portuguese Christian missionaries published a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named Thambiran Vanakkam thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. The Tamil Lexicon published by the University of Madras was one of the earliest dictionaries published in Indian languages.

Fevrálʹskaya revolyútsiya) known in Soviet historiography as the February Bourgeois Democratic Revolution and sometimes as the March Revolution was the first of two revolutions which took place in Russia in 1917.The main events of the revolution took place in and near Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg) the then-capital of Russia where long-standing discontent with the monarchy erupted into mass protests against food rationing on 23 February Old Style (8 March New Style). Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S. (12 March N.S.) the garrison forces of the capital sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later Tsar Nicholas II abdicated ending Romanov dynastic rule and the Russian Empire. A Russian Provisional Government under Prince Georgy Lvov replaced the Council of Ministers of Russia.The Provisional Government would prove deeply unpopular and was forced to share dual power with the Petrograd Soviet. After the July Days in which the Government killed hundreds of protesters Alexander Kerensky became head of Government. He was unable to fix Russia's immediate problems mass job and food shortages and attempted to keep Russia in the ever more unpopular war. The failures of the Provisional Government led to the October Revolution by the Communist Bolsheviks later that year. The February Revolution had weakened the country; the October Revolution broke it resulting in the Russian Civil War and the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.The revolution appeared to have broken out without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914. Disaffected soldiers from the city's garrison joined bread rioters primarily women in bread lines and industrial strikers on the streets. As more and more troops of the undisciplined garrison of the Capital deserted and with loyal troops away at the Front the city fell into chaos leading to the Tsar's decision to abdicate under his generals' advice. In all over 1300 people were killed during the protests of February 1917. The historiographical reasons for the revolution have varied. Soviets cited the cause as the anger of the proletariat against the bourgeois boiling over. The Russian Liberals cited World War I. Revisionists track it back to land disputes after the Serf era. Modern historians cite a combination of these factors and criticize the mythologization of the event.  1917 in Russia All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing Russian-language text Articles with GND identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from April 2020 CS1 maint others Commons category link is on Wikidata Dissolution of the Russian Empire Harv and Sfn no-target errors March 1917 events Nicholas II of Russia Russian Provisional Government Russian Revolution Short description is different from Wikidata Use dmy dates from January 2020 Wikipedia articles needing page number citations from September 2012\",\n",

       " 'Russian literature refers to the literature of Russia and its émigrés and to Russian-language literature. The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Middle Ages when epics and chronicles in Old East Slavic were composed. By the Age of Enlightenment literature had grown in importance and from the early 1830s Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry prose and drama. Romanticism permitted a flowering of poetic talent Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Prose was flourishing as well. Mikhail Lermontov was one of the most important poets and novelists. The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol. Then came Ivan Turgenev who mastered both short stories and novels. Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy soon became internationally renowned. Other important figures of Russian realism were Ivan Goncharov Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and Nikolai Leskov. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry. The poets most often associated with the \"Silver Age\" are Konstantin Balmont Valery Bryusov Alexander Blok Anna Akhmatova Nikolay Gumilyov Osip Mandelstam Sergei Yesenin Vladimir Mayakovsky Marina Tsvetaeva and Boris Pasternak. This era produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers such as Aleksandr Kuprin Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin Leonid Andreyev Fyodor Sologub Yevgeny Zamyatin Andrei Bely and Maxim Gorky.After the Revolution of 1917 Russian literature split into Soviet and white émigré parts. While the Soviet Union assured universal literacy and a highly developed book printing industry it also enforced ideological censorship. In the 1930s Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figures were Nikolay Ostrovsky Alexander Fadeyev and other writers who laid the foundations of this style. Ostrovsky\\'s novel How the Steel Was Tempered has been among the most popular works of Russian Socrealist literature. Some writers such as Mikhail Bulgakov Andrei Platonov and Daniil Kharms were criticized and wrote with little or no hope of being published. Various émigré writers such as poets Vladislav Khodasevich Georgy Ivanov and Vyacheslav Ivanov; novelists such as Gaito Gazdanov Vladimir Nabokov and Bunin continued to write in exile. Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology like Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov who wrote about life in the gulag camps. The Khrushchev Thaw brought some fresh wind to literature and poetry became a mass cultural phenomenon. This \"thaw\" did not last long; in the 1970s some of the most prominent authors were banned from publishing and prosecuted for their anti-Soviet sentiments.The end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature with few distinct voices. Among the most discussed authors of this period were Victor Pelevin who gained popularity with short stories and novels novelist and playwright Vladimir Sorokin and the poet Dmitri Prigov. In the 21st century a new generation of Russian authors appeared differing greatly from the postmodernist Russian prose of the late 20th century which lead critics to speak about \"new realism\".Russian authors have significantly contributed to numerous literary genres. Russia has five Nobel Prize in literature laureates. As of 2011 Russia was the fourth largest book producer in the world in terms of published titles.

Rossíyskaya Sovétskaya Federatívnaya Socialistíčeskaya Respúblika IPA [rɐˈsʲijskəjə sɐˈvʲetskəjə fʲɪdʲɪrɐˈtʲivnəjə sətsɨəlʲɪˈsʲtʲitɕɪskəjə rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə] (listen)) previously known as the Russian Soviet Republic and the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic as well as being unofficially known as Soviet Russia the Russian Federation or simply Russia was an independent federal socialist state from 1917 to 1922 and afterwards the largest and most populous of the Soviet socialist republics of the Soviet Union (USSR) from 1922 to 1991 until becoming a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with priority of Russian laws over Union-level legislation in 1990 and 1991 the last two years of the existence of the USSR. The Russian Republic was composed of sixteen smaller constituent units of autonomous republics five autonomous oblasts ten autonomous okrugs six krais and forty oblasts. Russians formed the largest ethnic group. The capital of the Russian SFSR was Moscow and the other major urban centers included Leningrad Stalingrad Novosibirsk Sverdlovsk Gorky and Kuybishev.The economy of Russia became heavily industrialized accounting for about two-thirds of the electricity produced in the USSR. By 1961 it was the third largest producer of petroleum due to new discoveries in the Volga-Urals region and Siberia trailing in production to only the United States and Saudi Arabia. In 1974 there were 475 institutes of higher education in the republic providing education in 47 languages to some 23941000 students. A network of territorially organized public-health services provided health care. After 1985 the \"perestroika\" restructuring policies of the Gorbachev administration relatively liberalised the economy which had become stagnant since the late 1970s under General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev with the introduction of non-state owned enterprises such as cooperatives.The Russian Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 7 November 1917 (October Revolution) as a sovereign state and the world\\'s first constitutionally socialist state guided by communist ideology. The first Constitution was adopted in 1918. In 1922 the Russian SFSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR officially setting up of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The 1977 Soviet Constitution stated that \"[a] Union Republic is a sovereign [...] state that has united [...] in the Union\" and \"each Union Republic shall retain the right freely to secede from the USSR\". On 12 June 1990 the Congress of People\\'s Deputies adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty established separation of powers (unlike in the Soviet form of government) established citizenship of Russia and stated that the RSFSR shall retain the right of free secession from the USSR. On 12 June 1991 Boris Yeltsin (1931–2007) supported by the Democratic Russia pro-reform movement was elected the first and only President of the RSFSR a post that would later become the presidency of the Russian Federation.The August 1991 Soviet coup d\\'état attempt with the temporary brief internment of President Mikhail Gorbachev destabilised the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1991 the heads of Russia Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its original founding states (i.e. renunciation of the 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a loose confederation. On 12 December the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet (the parliament of Russian SFSR); therefore the Russian SFSR had renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia\\'s independence from the USSR itself and the ties with the other Soviet Socialist Republics.On 25 December 1991 following the resignation of Gorbachev as President of the Soviet Union (and former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation. The next day after the lowering of the Soviet red flag from the top of the Kremlin Senate building of the Moscow Kremlin in Moscow the USSR was self-dissolved by the Soviet of the Republics on 26 December which by that time was the only functioning parliamentary chamber of the All-Union Supreme Soviet (the other house Soviet of the Union had already lost the quorum after recall of its members by the several union republics). After the dissolution Russia declared that it assumed the rights and obligations of the dissolved central Soviet government including UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council but originally excluding foreign debt and foreign assets of the USSR (also parts of the former Soviet Red Army and nuclear weapons remained under overall CIS command as CIS United Armed Forces).The 1978 RSFSR Constitution was amended several times to reflect the transition to democracy private property and market economy. The new Russian Constitution coming into effect on 25 December 1993 after a constitutional crisis completely abolished the Soviet form of government and replaced it with a semi-presidential system.  1917 establishments in Russia 1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union 20th century in Russia All articles to be expanded All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing Russian-language text Articles needing translation from Russian Wikipedia Articles to be expanded from June 2021 Articles to be expanded from March 2011 Articles using small message boxes Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with Russian-language sources (ru) Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with hAudio microformats Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from January 2014 Articles with unsourced statements from December 2016 Communism in Russia Eastern Bloc Federal republics Former Slavic countries Former countries Former countries in Asia Former countries in Europe Former polities of the Cold War Former socialist republics Modern history of Russia Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the flag caption or type parameters Pages using infobox country or infobox former country with the symbol caption or type parameters Republics of the Soviet Union Russian-speaking countries and territories Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Short description is different from Wikidata States and territories disestablished in 1991 States and territories established in 1917 Use dmy dates from August 2021 Webarchive template archiveis links Webarchive template wayback links Wikipedia articles needing clarification from March 2011 Wikipedia pages move-protected due to vandalism',\n",

Inherent in the study of women\\'s history is the belief that more traditional recordings of history have minimized or ignored the contributions of women to different fields and the effect that historical events had on women as a whole; in this respect women\\'s history is often a form of historical revisionism seeking to challenge or expand the traditional historical consensus.The main centers of scholarship have been the United States and Britain where second-wave feminist historians influenced by the new approaches promoted by social history led the way. As activists in women\\'s liberation discussing and analyzing the oppression and inequalities they experienced as women they believed it imperative to learn about the lives of their fore mothers—and found very little scholarship in print. History was written mainly by men and about men\\'s activities in the public sphere especially in Africa—war politics diplomacy and administration. Women are usually excluded and when mentioned are usually portrayed in sex stereotypical roles such as wives mothers daughters and mistresses.

It holds collections established during the mid-19th century. The Museum\\'s collection was amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors a father and son William Thompson Walters (1819–1894) who began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal SouthernConfederate sympathizer at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861; and Henry Walters (1848–1931) who refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction of a later landmark building to rehouse it. After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father\\'s and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place townhousemansion during the late 1800s he arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure built for that purpose in 1905–1909. Located across the back alley a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument StreetMount Vernon Place on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.The mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22000 works the original Charles Street Gallery building and his adjacent townhousemansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore \"for the benefit of the public.\" The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi medieval ivories illuminated manuscripts Renaissance bronzes Old Master European and 19th-century paintings Chinese ceramics and bronzes Art Deco jewelry and ancient Near East Mesopotamian or ancient Middle East items.In 2000 \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies.Starting on October 1 2006 the museum was enabled to make admission free to all year-round as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities. In 2012 \"The Walters\" released nearly 20000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license and collaborated in their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons.

Until the emergence of the book of hours in the Late Middle Ages psalters were the books most widely owned by wealthy lay persons. They were commonly used for learning to read. Many Psalters were richly illuminated and they include some of the most spectacular surviving examples of medieval book art.The English term (Old English psaltere saltere) derives from Church Latin. The source term is Latin psalterium which is simply the name of the Book of Psalms (in secular Latin it is the term for a stringed instrument from Ancient Greek ψαλτήριον psalterion).The Book of Psalms contains the bulk of the Divine Office of the Roman Catholic Church. The other books associated with it were the Lectionary the Antiphonary and Responsoriale and the Hymnary.In Late Modern English psalter has mostly ceased to refer to the Book of Psalms (as the text of a book of the Bible) and mostly refers to the dedicated physical volumes containing this text.

       " 'A self-portrait is a representation of an artist that is drawn painted photographed or sculpted by that artist. Although self-portraits have been made since the earliest times it is not until the Early Renaissance in the mid-15th century that artists can be frequently identified depicting themselves as either the main subject or as important characters in their work. With better and cheaper mirrors and the advent of the panel portrait many painters sculptors and printmakers tried some form of self-portraiture. Portrait of a Man in a Turban by Jan van Eyck of 1433 may well be the earliest known panel self-portrait. He painted a separate portrait of his wife and he belonged to the social group that had begun to commission portraits already more common among wealthy Netherlanders than south of the Alps. The genre is venerable but not until the Renaissance with increased wealth and interest in the individual as a subject did it become truly popular.

       " 'A limnic eruption also known as a lake overturn is a rare type of natural disaster in which dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters forming a gas cloud capable of suffocating wildlife livestock and humans. A limnic eruption may also cause tsunamis as the rising CO2 displaces water. Scientists believe earthquakes volcanic activity and other explosive events can serve as triggers for limnic eruptions. Lakes in which such activity occurs are referred to as limnically active lakes or exploding lakes. Some features of limnically active lakes includeCO2-saturated incoming waterA cool lake bottom indicating an absence of direct volcanic interaction with lake watersAn upper and lower thermal layer with differing CO2 saturationsProximity to areas with volcanic activityInvestigations of the Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos casualties led scientists to classify limnic eruptions as a distinct type of disaster event even though they can be indirectly linked to volcanic eruptions.

       " 'Baltimore ( BAWL-tim-or locally ; colloquially known simply as B\\'more) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maryland as well as the 30th most populous city in the United States with a population of 585708 in 2020. Baltimore was designated an independent city by the Constitution of Maryland in 1851 and today is the largest independent city in the United States. As of 2017 the population of the Baltimore metropolitan area was estimated to be just under 2.802 million making it the 21st largest metropolitan area in the country. Baltimore is located about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Washington D.C. making it a principal city in the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area (CSA) the third-largest CSA in the nation with a calculated 2018 population of 9797063.Prior to European colonization the Baltimore region was used as hunting grounds by the Susquehannock Native Americans who were primarily settled further north than where the city was later built. Colonists from the Province of Maryland established the Port of Baltimore in 1706 to support the tobacco trade with Europe and established the Town of Baltimore in 1729. The Battle of Baltimore was a pivotal engagement during the War of 1812 culminating in the failed British bombardment of Fort McHenry during which Francis Scott Key wrote a poem that would become \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" which was eventually designated as the American national anthem in 1931. During the Pratt Street Riot of 1861 the city was the site of some of the earliest violence associated with the American Civil War.The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad the oldest railroad in the United States was built in 1830 and cemented Baltimore\\'s status as a major transportation hub giving producers in the Midwest and Appalachia access to the city\\'s port. Baltimore\\'s Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States. In addition Baltimore was a major manufacturing center. After a decline in major manufacturing heavy industry and restructuring of the rail industry Baltimore has shifted to a service-oriented economy. Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University are the city\\'s top two employers. Baltimore and its surrounding region are home to the headquarters of a number of major organizations and government agencies including the NAACP ABET the National Federation of the Blind Catholic Relief Services the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Social Security Administration.Many of Baltimore\\'s neighborhoods have rich histories. The city is home to some of the earliest National Register Historic Districts in the nation including Fell\\'s Point Federal Hill and Mount Vernon. These were added to the National Register between 1969 and 1971 soon after historic preservation legislation was passed. Baltimore has more public statues and monuments per capita than any other city in the country. Nearly one third of the city\\'s buildings (over 65000) are designated as historic in the National Register which is more than any other U.S. city.  1729 establishments in Maryland All Wikipedia articles in need of updating All Wikipedia articles written in American English All articles containing potentially dated statements All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2010 Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2015 Articles containing potentially dated statements from January 2011 Articles containing potentially dated statements from June 2015 Articles containing potentially dated statements from March 2018 Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with EMU identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with MusicBrainz area identifiers Articles with NARA identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from April 2016 Articles with unsourced statements from April 2017 Articles with unsourced statements from February 2014 Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018 Articles with unsourced statements from September 2019 Baltimore CS1 Julian–Gregorian uncertainty CS1 Italian-language sources (it) CS1 maint others CS1 maint uses authors parameter Cities in Maryland Cities in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area Coordinates on Wikidata Former capitals of the United States Independent cities in the United States Maryland counties Maryland counties on the Chesapeake Bay Maryland populated places on the Chesapeake Bay Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia Pages using Sister project links with default search Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata Pages using infobox settlement with possible motto list Pages using the Kartographer extension Pages with non-numeric formatnum arguments Populated places established in 1729 Port cities and towns in Maryland Short description is different from Wikidata Short description matches Wikidata Ukrainian communities in the United States Use American English from October 2019 Use mdy dates from January 2019 Webarchive template wayback links Wikipedia articles in need of updating from December 2019',\n",

       " 'Alexei Maximovich Peshkov (Russian Алексей Максимович Пешков 28 March [O.S. 16 March] 1868 – 18 June 1936) primarily known as Maxim Gorky (Russian Максим Горький) was a Russian writer and political activist. He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Before his success as an author he traveled widely across the Russian Empire changing jobs frequently experiences which would later influence his writing.Gorky\\'s most famous works are a short story collection Sketches and Stories (1899) plays The Philistines (1901) The Lower Depths (1902) and Children of the Sun (1905) a poem The Song of the Stormy Petrel (1901) his autobiographical trilogy My Childhood In the World My Universities (1913–1923) and a novel Mother (1906). Gorky himself judged some of these works as failures and Mother has been frequently criticized (Gorky himself thought of Mother as one of his biggest failures). However there have been warmer judgements of some less-known post-revolutionary works such as the cycles Fragments from My Diary (1924) and Stories of 1922–1924 (1925) the novels The Artamonov Business (1925) and The Life of Klim Samgin (1925–1936); the latter is considered Gorky\\'s masterpiece and sometimes being viewed by critics as a modernist work. Unlike his pre-revolutionary writings (known for their \"anti-psychologism\") these differ with an ambivalent portrayal of the Russian Revolution and \"unmodern interest to human psychology\" (as noted by D. S. Mirsky). He had associations with fellow Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov; Gorky would later mention them in his memoirs.Gorky was active in the emerging Marxist communist movement. He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime and for a time closely associated himself with Lenin and Bogdanov\\'s Bolshevik wing of the party. For a significant part of his life he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union. In 1932 he returned to the USSR on Joseph Stalin\\'s personal invitation and lived there until his death in June 1936. After his return he was officially declared the \"founder of Socialist Realism\". Despite his official reputation Gorky\\'s relations with the Soviet regime were rather difficult. Modern scholars consider his ideology of God-Building as distinct from the official Marxism-Leninism and his work fits uneasily under the Socialist Realist label. His work remains controversial.  1868 births 1936 deaths 19th-century Russian dramatists and playwrights 19th-century Russian male writers 19th-century Russian novelists 19th-century Russian short story writers 19th-century pseudonymous writers 20th-century Russian dramatists and playwrights 20th-century Russian male writers 20th-century Russian novelists 20th-century Russian short story writers 20th-century pseudonymous writers AC with 35 elements All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify All articles with bare URLs for citations All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing Russian-language text Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from September 2021 Articles needing cleanup from September 2021 Articles with BIBSYS identifiers Articles with BNC identifiers Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with CANTIC identifiers Articles with CINII identifiers Articles with EMU identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ICCU identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with Internet Archive links Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with LNB identifiers Articles with LibriVox links Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers Articles with NARA identifiers Articles with NDL identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLA identifiers Articles with NLG identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with NLK identifiers Articles with NSK identifiers Articles with NTA identifiers Articles with PLWABN identifiers Articles with Project Gutenberg links Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with RISM identifiers Articles with RSL identifiers Articles with SELIBR identifiers Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with Trove identifiers Articles with ULAN identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with VcBA identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with bare URLs for citations from September 2021 Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018 Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021 Articles with unsourced statements from May 2011 Articles with unsourced statements from September 2021 Bolshevik finance Burials at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis CS1 Julian–Gregorian uncertainty CS1 long volume value CS1 Russian-language sources (ru) CS1 errors missing title CS1 maint extra text authors list Capri Campania Deaths from pneumonia in the Soviet Union EngvarB from August 2014 Male non-fiction writers Maxim Gorky Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch People from Nizhny Novgorod People from Nizhny Novgorod Governorate People from Sorrento Recipients of the Order of Lenin Russian Marxist writers Russian anti-capitalists Russian atheists Russian male dramatists and playwrights Russian male novelists Russian male short story writers Russian memoirists Short description is different from Wikidata Socialist realism writers Soviet dramatists and playwrights Soviet male writers Soviet non-fiction writers Soviet novelists Soviet short story writers Use dmy dates from January 2021',\n",

       " 'Jesus (Greek Ἰησοῦς romanized Iēsoûs likely from HebrewAramaic יֵשׁוּעַ\\u200e romanized Yēšūaʿ; c.\\u20094 BC – AD 30 33) also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure of Christianity the world\\'s largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically. The quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus as the only records of Jesus\\' life are contained in the Gospels. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission and he himself was often referred to as \"rabbi\". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God engaged in healings taught in parables and gathered followers. He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities turned over to the Roman government and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate the Roman prefect. After his death his followers believed he rose from the dead and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit was born of a virgin named Mary performed miracles founded the Christian Church died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven from where he will return. Commonly Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son the second of three persons of the Trinity. A small minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism wholly or partly as non-scriptural. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 as Christmas. His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The widely used calendar era \"AD\" from the Latin anno Domini (\"year of the Lord\") and the equivalent alternative \"CE\" are based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity in religions such as Manichaeism Islam and the Bahá’í Faith. Manicheanism was the first organised religion outside of Christianity to venerate Jesus viewing him as an important prophet. In Islam Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ʿĪsā) is considered the penultimate prophet of God and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin but was neither God nor a son of God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed to be divine. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. In contrast Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies and was neither divine nor resurrected.  0s BC births 1st-century BCE Jews 1st-century BC Romans 1st-century Romans 1st-century apocalypticists 1st-century executions 1st-century rabbis 30s deaths AC with 25 elements Angelic visionaries Articles containing Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text Articles containing Hebrew-language text Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia with Wikisource reference Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with LNB identifiers Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers Articles with NDL identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLA identifiers Articles with NLG identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with NSK identifiers Articles with NTA identifiers Articles with PLWABN identifiers Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with RISM identifiers Articles with RSL identifiers Articles with SELIBR identifiers Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with TDVİA identifiers Articles with Trove identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with hAudio microformats Articles with hCards Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from June 2021 Carpenters Creator gods Deified people Exorcists Faith healers Featured articles Founders of religions God in Christianity Harv and Sfn no-target errors Jesus Jewish messiah claimants Judean people Life-death-rebirth gods Messianism People considered avatars by their followers People executed by crucifixion People executed by the Roman Empire People from Bethlehem People from Nazareth Prophets of the New Testament Publicly executed people Rabbis of the Land of Israel Roman-era Jews Savior gods Self-declared messiahs Short description is different from Wikidata Spoken articles Torture victims Use mdy dates from June 2020 Webarchive template wayback links Wikipedia indefinitely move-protected pages Wikipedia indefinitely semi-protected pages Wonderworkers Year of birth uncertain Year of death uncertain',\n",

       " 'The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία tà biblía \\'the books\\') is a collection of religious texts writings or scriptures sacred in Christianity Judaism Samaritanism Islam Rastafari and many other faiths. It appears in the form of an anthology a compilation of texts of a variety of forms that are all linked by the belief that they are collectively revelations of God. These texts include theologically-focused historical accounts hymns prayers proverbs parables didactic letters admonitions essays poetry and prophecies. Believers also generally consider the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration.Those books that are included in the Bible by a tradition or group are called canonical indicating that the traditiongroup views the collection as the true representation of God\\'s word and will. A number of biblical canons have evolved with overlapping and diverging contents from denomination to denomination. The Hebrew Bible shares most of its content with its ancient Greek translation the Septuagint which in turn was the base for the Christian Old Testament. The Christian New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians believed to be Jewish disciples of Christ written in 1st-century Koine Greek. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon primarily about the biblical apocrypha a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect or recognition.Attitudes towards the Bible also differ among Christian groups. Roman Catholics High Church Anglicans Methodists and Eastern Orthodox Christians stress the harmony and importance of both the Bible and sacred tradition while many Protestant churches focus on the idea of sola scriptura or scripture alone. This concept rose to prominence during the Reformation and many denominations today support the use of the Bible as the only infallible source of Christian teaching. Others though advance the concept of prima scriptura in contrast meaning scripture primarily or scripture mainly.The Bible has had a profound influence on literature and history especially in the Western world where the Gutenberg Bible was the first book printed using movable type. According to the March 2007 edition of Time the Bible \"has done more to shape literature history entertainment and culture than any book ever written. Its influence on world history is unparalleled and shows no signs of abating.\" With estimated total sales of over five billion copies it is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time. As of the 2000s it sells approximately 100 million copies annually.

       " 'Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was founded in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy who argued in her 1875 book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science\\'s central text along with the Bible and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1879 to found the \"Church of Christ (Scientist)\"; the church would be reorganized under the name \"Church of Christ Scientist\" in 1892. The Mother Church The First Church of Christ Scientist was built in Boston Massachusetts in 1894. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States with nearly 270000 members there by 1936 a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100000 and by 2009 reportedly to under 50000. The church is known for its newspaper The Christian Science Monitor which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.Eddy described Christian Science as a return to \"primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing\". There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity. In particular adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion. This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists optometrists obstetricians physicians for broken bones and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for and in a few cases convicted of manslaughter or neglect.  1879 establishments in Massachusetts All articles lacking reliable references All articles with failed verification Articles lacking reliable references from March 2021 Articles with BIBSYS identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with failed verification from March 2021 Articles with short description Christian Science Christian new religious movements Christianity in Massachusetts Commons category link from Wikidata Good articles Harv and Sfn no-target errors New Thought Nontrinitarian denominations Organizations based in Boston Religious belief systems founded in the United States Short description is different from Wikidata Webarchive template archiveis links Webarchive template wayback links',\n",

       " \"The term freshet is most commonly used to describe a spring thaw resulting from snow and ice melt in rivers located in upper North America. A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems resulting in significant inundation of flood plains as the snowpack melts in the river's watershed. Freshets can occur with differing strength and duration depending upon the depth of the snowpack and the local average rates of warming temperatures. Deeper snowpacks which melt quickly can result in more severe flooding. Late spring melts allow for faster flooding; this is because the relatively longer days and higher solar angle allow for average melting temperatures to be reached quickly causing snow to melt rapidly. Snowpacks at higher altitudes and in mountainous areas remain cold and tend to melt over a longer period of time and thus do not contribute to major flooding. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large tropical weather systems rolling in from the South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico to add their powerful heating capacity to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect snow cover to latitudes as far north as southern Canada so long as the generally colder air mass is not blocking northward movement of low pressure systems.In the eastern part of the continent annual freshets occur from the Canadian Taiga ranging along both sides of the Great Lakes then down through the heavily forested Appalachian mountain chain and St. Lawrence valley from Northern Maine and New Brunswick into barrier ranges in North Carolina and Tennessee.In the western part of the continent freshets occur throughout the generally much higher elevations of the various west coast mountain ranges that extend southward down from Alaska even into the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico.The term can also refer to the followingA flood resulting from heavy rain or a spring thaw. Whereas heavy rain often causes a flash flood a spring thaw event is generally a more incremental process depending upon local climate and topography.A stream river or flood of fresh water which empties into the ocean usually flowing through an estuary.A small stream of fresh water irrespective of its outflow.A pool of fresh water according to Samuel Johnson and followed in Thomas Sheridan's dictionary but this might have been a misinterpretation on Johnson's part and it is at best not a common usage.

This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.Tidal barrages are among the oldest methods of tidal power generation with tide mills being developed as early as the sixth century.

       " 'A smart lock is an electromechanical lock which is designed to perform locking and unlocking operations on a door when it receives such instructions from an authorized device using a wireless protocol and a cryptographic key to execute the authorization process. It also monitors access and sends alerts for the different events it monitors and some other critical events related to the status of the device. Smart locks can be considered part of a smart home.Most smart locks are installed on mechanical locks (simple types of locks including deadbolts) and they physically upgrade the ordinary lock. Recently smart locking controllers have also appeared at the market. Smart locks like the traditional locks need two main parts to work the lock and the key. In the case of these electronic locks the key is not a physical key but a smartphone or a special key fob configured explicitly for this purpose which wirelessly performs the authentication needed to automatically unlock the door.Smart locks allow users to grant access to a third party by means of a virtual key. This key can be sent to the recipient smartphone over standard messaging protocols such as e-mail or SMS. Once this key is received the recipient will be able to unlock the smart lock during the time previously specified by the sender.Smart locks are able to grant or deny access remotely via a mobile app. Certain smart locks include a built-in Wi-Fi connection that allows for monitoring features such as access notifications or cameras to show the person requesting access. Some smart locks work with a smart doorbell to allow the user to see who and when someone is at a door. Many smart locks now also feature Biometric features like fingerprint sensors. Biometrics are becoming increasingly popular because they offer more security than passwords alone. This is because they use unique physical characteristics rather than stored information.This means that biometric authentication isn’t about remembering something but about recognizing something about yourself.Smart locks may use Bluetooth Low Energy and SSL to communicate encrypting communications using 128256-bit AES.

Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining harvested rain. A rainwater catchment or collection (also known as \"rainwater harvesting\") system can yield 2358 litres (623 US gal) of water from 2.54 cm (1.00 in) of rain on a 92.9 m2 (1000 sq ft) roof.Rainwater tanks are installed to make use of rain water for later use reduce mains water use for economic or environmental reasons and aid self-sufficiency. Stored water may be used for watering gardens agriculture flushing toilets in washing machines washing cars and also for drinking especially when other water supplies are unavailable expensive or of poor quality and when adequate care is taken that the water is not contaminated and is adequately filtered.Underground rainwater tanks can also be used for retention of stormwater for release at a later time and offer a variety of benefits described in more detail below. In arid climates rain barrels are often used to store water during the rainy season for use during dryer periods.Rainwater tanks may have a high (perceived) initial cost. However many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute quantities of water for landscapinggardening applications rather than as a potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or in some cases whiskey and wine aging barrels are often inexpensive. There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water. While most are properly engineered to screen out mosquitoes the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.

       " 'Malolactic conversion (also known as malolactic fermentation or MLF) is a process in winemaking in which tart-tasting malic acid naturally present in grape must is converted to softer-tasting lactic acid. Malolactic fermentation is most often performed as a secondary fermentation shortly after the end of the primary fermentation but can sometimes run concurrently with it. The process is standard for most red wine production and common for some white grape varieties such as Chardonnay where it can impart a \"buttery\" flavor from diacetyl a byproduct of the reaction.The fermentation reaction is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria (LAB); Oenococcus oeni and various species of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus. Chemically malolactic fermentation is a decarboxylation which means carbon dioxide is liberated in the process.The primary function of all these bacteria is to convert L-malic acid one of the two major grape acids found in wine to another type of acid L+ lactic acid. This can occur naturally. However in commercial winemaking malolactic conversion typically is initiated by an inoculation of desirable bacteria usually O. oeni. This prevents undesirable bacterial strains from producing \"off\" flavors. Conversely commercial winemakers actively prevent malolactic conversion when it is not desired such as with fruity and floral white grape varieties such as Riesling and Gewürztraminer to maintain a more tart or acidic profile in the finished wine.Malolactic fermentation tends to create a rounder fuller mouthfeel. Malic acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity much of which comes from the contribution of malic acid. Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel.A wine undergoing malolactic conversion will be cloudy because of the presence of bacteria and may have the smell of buttered popcorn the result of the production of diacetyl. The onset of malolactic fermentation in the bottle is usually considered a wine fault as the wine will appear to the consumer to still be fermenting (as a result of CO2 being produced). However for early Vinho Verde production this slight effervesce was considered a distinguishing trait though Portuguese wine producers had to market the wine in opaque bottles because of the increase in turbidity and sediment that the \"in-bottle MLF\" produced. Today most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottling with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.

       " 'A color breed refers to groupings of horses whose registration is based primarily on their coat color regardless of the horse\\'s actual breed or breed type. Some color breeds only register horses with a desired coat color if they also meet specific pedigree criteria others register animals based solely on color regardless of parentage. A few pedigree-based color breeds notably the American Paint Horse and the Appaloosa confronted with the reality of many animals born without the proper color even though they are from two registered parents have modified their rules to allow registration of animals with the proper pedigree even if they do not possess the proper color. On the other hand with the prevalence of DNA testing for parentage many horses once forced into color breed status due to being born the \"wrong\" color and thus deemed undesirable or of questionable parentage by many regular breed registries with cropout rules can now be accepted for registration. For example some mainstream breeds such as American Quarter Horses Tennessee Walking Horses and American Saddlebreds include individuals of the palomino color or pinto patterns as well as a wide variety of other colors. However a color breed registry such as the Palomino Horse Breeders Association or the Pinto Horse Association of America accepts only horses of each particular color or color pattern —regardless of their particular breeds. White horses had their own color registry that included cremello horses but not grays.Many horses eligible for registration with their own breed registry and of a particular color to allow color breed registration are often \"double registered\" with both organizations often increasing their sale value by doing so. With stallions double registration may also increase their breeding value by widening the set of interested mare owners.

According to a published history of the county club Surrey casting around for an amateur captain to lead the side in the hastily arranged first season of first-class cricket after the war alighted on the name \"Major Bennett\". The intention appears to have been to offer the job to Leo Bennett but instead another club cricketer Major Nigel Harvie Bennett who had also played a few second eleven matches pre-war was asked and he accepted the job.Most of Leo Bennett\\'s cricket was at club level where he was a prominent player over many seasons and a frequent player and captain in the minor warm-up matches for the Club Cricket Conference against touring sides; he was also the captain for the BBC cricket team. During the Second World War however Bennett played alongside some bigger cricketing names in matches for among others the British Empire XI although these games were not first-class.In 1947 and the following two seasons he turned out in a total of 16 first-class matches for Northamptonshire making useful runs in his first and last seasons. His best match came against Nottinghamshire at Northampton in August 1947 when he scored 56 in the first innings and 68 in the second his two highest first-class scores. Northamptonshire still lost the match by a large margin.His obituary in Wisden Cricketers\\' Almanack credits him with a book on club cricket and he appears to have moved in exalted cricketing circles in his latter life. As late as 1962 and 1963 he was captaining Lord\\'s Taverners teams in less-than-serious matches at Lord\\'s players who turned out under his captaincy included Keith Miller David Sheppard and Norman Wisdom.Bennett was commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers in June 1943 but later transferred to the Worcestershire Regiment.

She is generally credited with having influenced George Lansbury the Labour politician and future party leader to take up the cause of votes for women when she acted as his agent in the general election campaign of 1906. Lansbury became one of the strongest advocates for the women's cause in the pre-1914 era.Hansen spent her almost her whole life in Middlesbrough and was an active member of the local Independent Labour Party (ILP). Born into the well-to-do Coates family she was drawn to socialism through her association with Joseph Fels the American industrialist and social reformer for whom she worked as a nanny in Philadelphia in the early 1890s. She was one of a group who left the WSPU in protest against the increasingly autocratic attitudes of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family towards the organisation's general membership. After the First World War she took up local politics in Middlesbrough became a local councillor in Middlesbrough and was involved in housing reform and slum clearance.

       " 'Saudi Arabia officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a country in Western Asia It spans the vast majority of the Arabian Peninsula with a land area of approximately 2150000 km2 (830000 sq mi) Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East and the second-largest country in the Arab world It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq to the north Kuwait to the northeast Qatar Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to the east Oman to the southeast and Yemen to the south; it is separated from Egypt and Israel in the north-west by the Gulf of Aqaba Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and most of its terrain consists of arid desert lowland steppe and mountains Its capital and largest city is Riyadh with Mecca and Medina serving as important cultural and religious centersThe territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world The world\\'s second-largest religion Islam emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia In the early 7th century the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity Following his death in 632 his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East) in a matter of decades Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661) Umayyad (661–750) Abbasid (750–1517) and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia Africa and EuropeThe area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions Hejaz Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and Southern Arabia (\\'Asir) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West) He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh the ancestral home of his family the House of Saud Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamist lines The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a \"predominant feature of Saudi culture\"; although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in recent years In its Basic Law Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion Arabic as its official language and Riyadh as its capital Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"the Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina) the two holiest places in IslamPetroleum was discovered on 3 March 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province Saudi Arabia has since become the world\\'s second largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world\\'s largest oil exporter controlling the world\\'s second largest oil reserves and the sixth largest gas reserves The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economiesHowever the state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons including its role in the Yemeni Civil War alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record which has been characterized by the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment failure to adopt adequate measures against human trafficking state-sponsored discrimination against religious minorities and atheists and antisemitism and its strict interpretation of Shari\\'a lawThe kingdom spends 8% of its GDP on the military (highest in the world after Oman) which places it as the world\\'s third biggest military spender behind the United States and China and the world\\'s largest arms importer from 2015 to 2019 receiving half of all the US arms exports to the Middle East According to the BICC Saudi Arabia is the 28th most militarized country in the world and enjoys the region\\'s best military equipment qualitatively after Israel However in recent years there have been continual calls for halting of arms sales to Saudi Arabia mainly due to alleged war crimes in Yemen and especially following the assassination of Jamal KhashoggiSaudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East and eighteenth-largest in the world Saudi Arabia also has one of the world\\'s youngest populations with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 342 million being under 25 years old In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council Saudi Arabia is an active and

Gorky would later mention them in his memoirsGorky was active in the emerging Marxist communist movement He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime and for a time closely associated himself with Lenin and Bogdanov\\'s Bolshevik wing of the party For a significant part of his life he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union In 1932 he returned to the USSR on Joseph Stalin\\'s personal invitation and lived there until his death in June 1936 After his return he was officially declared the \"founder of Socialist Realism\" Despite his official reputation Gorky\\'s relations with the Soviet regime were rather difficult Modern scholars consider his ideology of God-Building as distinct from the official Marxism-Leninism and his work fits uneasily under the Socialist Realist label His work remains controversial  1868 births 1936 deaths 19th-century Russian dramatists and playwrights 19th-century Russian male writers 19th-century Russian novelists 19th-century Russian short story writers 19th-century pseudonymous writers 20th-century Russian dramatists and playwrights 20th-century Russian male writers 20th-century Russian novelists 20th-century Russian short story writers 20th-century pseudonymous writers AC with 35 elements All articles covered by WikiProject Wikify All articles with bare URLs for citations All articles with unsourced statements Articles containing Russian-language text Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from September 2021 Articles needing cleanup from September 2021 Articles with BIBSYS identifiers Articles with BNC identifiers Articles with BNE identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with CANTIC identifiers Articles with CINII identifiers Articles with EMU identifiers Articles with FAST identifiers Articles with GND identifiers Articles with ICCU identifiers Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with Internet Archive links Articles with LCCN identifiers Articles with LNB identifiers Articles with LibriVox links Articles with MusicBrainz identifiers Articles with NARA identifiers Articles with NDL identifiers Articles with NKC identifiers Articles with NLA identifiers Articles with NLG identifiers Articles with NLI identifiers Articles with NLK identifiers Articles with NSK identifiers Articles with NTA identifiers Articles with PLWABN identifiers Articles with Project Gutenberg links Articles with RERO identifiers Articles with RISM identifiers Articles with RSL identifiers Articles with SELIBR identifiers Articles with SNAC-ID identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with Trove identifiers Articles with ULAN identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with VcBA identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Articles with bare URLs for citations from September 2021 Articles with multiple identifiers Articles with short description Articles with unsourced statements from March 2018 Articles with unsourced statements from March 2021 Articles with unsourced statements from May 2011 Articles with unsourced statements from September 2021 Bolshevik finance Burials at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis CS1 Julian–Gregorian uncertainty CS1 long volume value CS1 Russian-language sources (ru) CS1 errors missing title CS1 maint extra text authors list Capri Campania Deaths from pneumonia in the Soviet Union EngvarB from August 2014 Male non-fiction writers Maxim Gorky Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata Pages using Sister project links with wikidata namespace mismatch People from Nizhny Novgorod People from Nizhny Novgorod Governorate People from Sorrento Recipients of the Order of Lenin Russian Marxist writers Russian anti-capitalists Russian atheists Russian male dramatists and playwrights Russian male novelists Russian male short story writers Russian memoirists Short description is different from Wikidata Socialist realism writers Soviet dramatists and playwrights Soviet male writers Soviet non-fiction writers Soviet novelists Soviet short story writers Use dmy dates from January 2021',\n",

first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader He is the central figure of Christianity the world\\'s largest religion Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew BibleVirtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically The quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus as the only records of Jesus\\' life are contained in the Gospels Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission and he himself was often referred to as \"rabbi\" Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God engaged in healings taught in parables and gathered followers He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities turned over to the Roman government and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate the Roman prefect After his death his followers believed he rose from the dead and the community they formed eventually became the early ChurchChristian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit was born of a virgin named Mary performed miracles founded the Christian Church died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven from where he will return Commonly Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son the second of three persons of the Trinity A small minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism wholly or partly as non-scriptural The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 as Christmas His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday The widely used calendar era \"AD\" from the Latin anno Domini (\"year of the Lord\") and the equivalent alternative \"CE\" are based on the approximate birthdate of JesusJesus is also revered outside of Christianity in religions such as Manichaeism Islam and the Bahá’í Faith Manicheanism was the first organised religion outside of Christianity to venerate Jesus viewing him as an important prophet In Islam Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ʿĪsā) is considered the penultimate prophet of God and the messiah Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin but was neither God nor a son of God The Quran states that Jesus never claimed to be divine Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive In contrast Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies and was neither divine nor resurrected  0s BC births 1st-century BCE Jews 1st-century BC Romans 1st-century Romans 1st-century

       " 'Malolactic conversion (also known as malolactic fermentation or MLF) is a process in winemaking in which tart-tasting malic acid naturally present in grape must is converted to softer-tasting lactic acid Malolactic fermentation is most often performed as a secondary fermentation shortly after the end of the primary fermentation but can sometimes run concurrently with it The process is standard for most red wine production and common for some white grape varieties such as Chardonnay where it can impart a \"buttery\" flavor from diacetyl a byproduct of the reactionThe fermentation reaction is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria (LAB); Oenococcus oeni and various species of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus Chemically malolactic fermentation is a decarboxylation which means carbon dioxide is liberated in the processThe primary function of all these bacteria is to convert L-malic acid one of the two major grape acids found in wine to another type of acid L+ lactic acid This can occur naturally However in commercial winemaking malolactic conversion typically is initiated by an inoculation of desirable bacteria usually O oeni This prevents undesirable bacterial strains from producing \"off\" flavors Conversely commercial winemakers actively prevent malolactic conversion when it is not desired such as with fruity and floral white grape varieties such as Riesling and Gewürztraminer to maintain a more tart or acidic profile in the finished wineMalolactic fermentation tends to create a rounder fuller mouthfeel Malic acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity much of which comes from the contribution of malic acid Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine producing wines of greater palate softness Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrelA wine undergoing malolactic conversion will be cloudy because of the presence of bacteria and may have the smell of buttered popcorn the result of the production of diacetyl The onset of malolactic fermentation in the bottle is usually considered a wine fault as the wine will appear to the consumer to still be fermenting (as a result of CO2 being produced) However for early Vinho Verde production this slight effervesce was considered a distinguishing trait though Portuguese wine producers had to market the wine in opaque bottles because of the increase in turbidity and sediment that the \"in-bottle MLF\" produced Today most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottling with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation  Webarchive template wayback links Winemaking',\n",
